# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 22 July 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how the custom GPTs created by **@music256** (referred to as "the developer") handle user data.

## 1. Data Collection

By default, these GPTs **do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data** from users.

However, depending on the functionality of each GPT, the following data may be temporarily processed during usage:

- **Message content** (within the current ChatGPT session)
- **Public API responses**, such as:
  - Quota data from GitHub
  - Status data from OpenAI
  - JSON endpoints from Vercel

No data is saved outside of the ChatGPT platform.

## 2. Third-Party APIs

Some GPTs use external APIs such as:

- [GitHub raw file APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/)
- [Vercel-hosted endpoints](https://vercel.com/)
- [OpenAI platform status APIs](https://status.openai.com/)

These APIs are read-only and do not receive user-identifying information.

## 3. User Authentication

Unless explicitly stated, these GPTs do **not** require user authentication or API tokens.

If authentication is added in future GPTs (e.g., user connects a private API key), the user will be clearly informed in the GPT interface.

## 4. Data Retention

No data is retained or logged outside the ChatGPT session. The developer does not have access to any user conversation history.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated from time to time to reflect future changes in the GPTs’ behavior. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.

## 6. Contact

For questions or concerns, please contact the developer via GitHub:
